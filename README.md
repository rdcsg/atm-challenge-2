This is my second attempt at the atm challenge and instead of building upon the files I have in the first round and repo, I start fresh to maximize the learning experience.

The ATM challenge at Craftacademy.se is the first week of learning how to code Ruby and simulates some situations where a person interacts with an ATM machine to withdraw and deposit money.
